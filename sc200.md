# 🛡️ SC-200 Microsoft Security Operations Analyst Cheat Sheet

Covers Microsoft Defender, Sentinel, identity protection, data security, incident response, and automation.



## 🧠 1. Mitigate threats using Microsoft 365 Defender (25–30%)

### 🔍 Core Tools
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** – Threat and vulnerability management (TVM), EDR
- **Microsoft Defender for Office 365** – Email/phishing protection, Safe Links/Attachments
- **Microsoft Defender for Identity** – On-prem AD monitoring, lateral movement detection
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (MCAS)** – Shadow IT, app discovery, session controls

### 🚨 Incident Management
- Use **Microsoft 365 Defender portal** (security.microsoft.com)
- Investigate incidents, view alerts, take action (isolate device, run AV scan)

### 🧩 Common Techniques Detected
- Pass-the-Hash
- Golden Ticket
- Lateral Movement
- Credential theft
- Phishing & Business Email Compromise

## 🛰️ 2. Mitigate threats using Microsoft Sentinel (40–45%)

### 🛠️ Core Concepts
- **SIEM + SOAR** – Log aggregation + response automation
- **Workspace** – Azure Monitor Log Analytics
- **KQL (Kusto Query Language)** – Used to query logs

### 📦 Data Connectors
- Bring in logs from:
  - Microsoft 365, Azure AD, Defender
  - Syslog, CEF for external sources

### 📊 Analytics Rules
- Create detections using KQL
- **Scheduled** (regular checks) or **NRT** (near-real-time)

### ⚡ Automation
- **Playbooks** – Built using Logic Apps
- Respond to incidents automatically (email, ticket, isolate host, etc.)

### 📌 Hunting
- Manual investigation using KQL
- Look for anomalies and patterns (e.g., logins from rare locations)

---

## 🔐 3. Mitigate threats using Microsoft Defender for Cloud (15–20%)

### 🛡️ Defender for Cloud
- Security posture management
- Recommendations for hardening
- Defender plans for: VMs, App Service, Containers, SQL, etc.

### 🚨 Security Alerts
- Get alerts on suspicious activities (e.g., crypto mining on VM)
- Use **JIT VM access**, **Adaptive network hardening**

### ☁️ Azure Policy & Recommendations
- View **secure score**
- Implement **remediations** based on security baseline

---

## 🔑 4. Mitigate threats using Microsoft Purview & compliance solutions (10–15%)

### 📁 Microsoft Purview
- **Information Protection** – Labels, DLP, encryption
- **Insider Risk Management** – Detect risky user behavior
- **Communication Compliance** – Monitor Teams/Email messages
- **Audit Logs** – Full vs Default audit modes

### 🔐 Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Prevent sensitive data exfiltration (e.g., credit card numbers)
- Apply to Exchange, OneDrive, Teams, and endpoints

### 🔍 eDiscovery
- **Core eDiscovery** – Search/export content
- **Advanced eDiscovery** – Legal holds, data analysis

## 🔧 Practice Focus Areas
- Creating **analytics rules** and **workbooks** in Sentinel
- Building **KQL queries** to detect threats
- Configuring **automated responses** using playbooks
- Setting up **Defender for Endpoint policies** and reviewing alerts
- **Hunting across logs** from multiple sources (endpoint, identity, cloud)
- Configuring **DLP policies**, **audit logs**, and **Purview compliance alerts**

## 🧪 Sample KQL Query
```kql
SigninLogs
| where ResultType == 50074
| project UserPrincipalName, IPAddress, Location, Timestamp
```

📌 Tips for the Exam
- Expect case-based questions with incident walkthroughs
- Be comfortable with reading and writing KQL
- Know how each Defender product fits in the ecosystem
- Understand Sentinel automation and threat hunting
- Don't ignore Purview & compliance — small % but easy points
